# ELK (Etsy Longtail Keywords)
## About
Elk (Etsy Longtail Keywords) is an Applescript app that uses Etsy's auto-populating native search bar to find longtail keyword terms used by real shoppers.

## The Problem
SEO is a critical part of getting found on Etsy and has a steep learning curve. Without keyword research, it is difficult to implement words to use for your tags and listing descriptions that will help customers find your shop and products.

## The Solution
Elk removes the manual, time-consuming part of keyword research by automating the process of gathering phrases used by real Etsy shoppers. Elk uses Etsy's autopopulating search bar to find and save every possible combination of phrases and then saves them in a new Google Sheet.

## Requirements
- MacOS X+
- Safari web browser
- Internet connection

## How to use
- Use Safari to login to your existing Etsy shop account
- Run (double click) "elk.app"
- Let the app run and do not close the Safari window or the data gathering process will be interrupted.
